# hello-world
## Testen von Gh
This is a test of changing the README.md file 
Using *asterisks* oder _underscores_ for italic emphasis
Scratching stuff using the ~~two tildes~~ 
1. Listing 
2. Listing more 
  * Bringing in a unordered sub-list via bullet point using asterisk or minus or plus
Putting urls in brackets so they are converted to [links](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) like this [https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet] 

I can also highlight inline `code` with back-ticks.
Or even syntax-highlight: 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
